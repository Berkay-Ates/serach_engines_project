    - after modifying save it with .ui extension
2. convert ui to python 
    - pyuic5 dosya_adÄ±.ui -o dosya_adÄ±.py
3. use it in program.
    - You cannot change auto generated py files from .ui so,you should write a wrapper for auto generated py files, which utilizes the auto generated py.
    - whenever the auto generated py files re-generated user changes will be overritten so we need wrapper here.
